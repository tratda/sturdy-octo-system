The Web Script Server uses DOCKER and GIT in order to produce a turnkey 
solution to Prompt #2. Requirements: DOCKER 

The Build and Run can be completed with the script:

./docker_start.sh

Stopping the container can be accomplished with the script:
./docker_stop.sh

Building the Enviroment:
In order to use the Web Script Server, DOCKER must 
be installed in your development enviroment. Once DOCKER is installed,
move to the directory that this README is in and build the DOCKERFILE 
with  the command:

"docker build -t git_web_scripter ."

This command tells docker to build the Dockerfile located in the 
current directory and call it git_web_scripter.


Running the Container:
Once the Dockerfile is built, it is stored in your development enviroments
local Docker image registry. It can be run in the foreground with the  
command:

"docker run -p 443:443 -p 22:22 git_web_scripter"

Or it can be run in the background in detached mode with the command:

"docker run -d -p 443:443 -p 22:22 git_web_scripter"

Either way it will run mapping the ports of the local machine to 443 and 22 to
the coresponding ports on the docker container. 

In detached mode it can be stopped with the commands:

"conID=$(docker container ls | grep git_web_server | cut -d ' ' -f 1)"

"docker container stop $conID"


Executing scripts on the Container:

Once the container is running you can interact with it via GIT and HTTPS.
To place scripts to be run by the container on the server, you must clone
the git repo to your local machine with the command:

"git clone admin@localhost:admin"

Place the scripts you want to run into this directory, commit the changes, 
then push the repo back to the server with the commands:

"git push"

When a user browses to localhost on port 443, the webserver executes all the
scripts in the git repo in the server and displays the output in the browser.
